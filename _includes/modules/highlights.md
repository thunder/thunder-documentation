**Thunder Admin Theme**: Admin theme created for Thunder with bigger UX improvements according to the findings of recent user tests and a survey conducted with editors currently working with Thunder.<br />

**Content Moderation**: Content Moderation enables you to have an editorial workflow. Editors can have different permissions for creating, editing and publishing articles. It also allows you to have a published version of an article, and have a separate working copy that is undergoing review before it is published.

**Paragraphs**: Instead of putting all their content in one WYSIWYG body field including images and videos, end-users can now choose on-the-fly between pre-defined Paragraph Types independent from one another. Paragraph Types can be anything you want from a simple text block or image to a complex and configurable slideshow. This allows editors to structure an article into sub-elements, which can easily be created, edited, and reorganized.<br />

**Entity Browser**: This module provides a generic entity browser/picker/selector. In Thunder, it serves as media library which gives you an overview of all your media entities, such as pictures and videos. You can filter and search for them, edit them, and add new media.<br />

**Autosave Form**: The “Autosave Form” module provides an autosave feature for all forms. The autosave submits will be triggered every 60 seconds and store the changes from the currently logged-in user in the database.

**Thunder Updater**: This is a combination of the modules Checklist API and Configuration Update Manager. Thunder checks if installed configurations have been changed – if not, they can be updated. Otherwise you will get a message telling you that there’s an available update and what to do if you wish to have it.<br />
