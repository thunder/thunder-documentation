Using 'composer', you can also manage the dependencies of your Thunder site and extensions.

To add an extension to your project, go to the root of your site (there should be a `composer.json` file) and add modules by typing
```
$ composer require drupal/[short name of the extension]
```
into the command line.

For example:

```
$ composer require drupal/webform
```
