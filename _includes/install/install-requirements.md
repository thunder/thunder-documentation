You have to install `PHP`, `composer` and `git` on your computer before you can install Thunder. The `composer` requires `git` command for proper functioning.

To install `PHP` please take a look at official [Installation and Configuration](https://www.php.net/manual/install.php) for `PHP`.
On top of `PHP`, you need to install the required libraries. Thunder installation requires the following `PHP` libraries: `xmlwriter`, `gd`, `mbstring`, `curl`, `json` and `pdo_sqlite`. The installation of `PHP` extensions can differ between operating systems, that's why you should check for detailed instructions on `PHP` [Installation and Configuration](https://www.php.net/manual/install.php).

To install `composer`, you can check the `composer` [installation instructions](https://getcomposer.org/download) and for `git` you can find installation instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
