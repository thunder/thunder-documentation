You can find extensions on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org). On [the following page](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module?f%5B3%5D=drupal_core%3A7234), you can search for `Modules` and on [this page](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme?f%5B2%5D=drupal_core%3A7234) for `Themes`. You can find further information on extensions in [the Drupal User Guide - Extending and Customizing Your Site](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/extend-chapter.html).

If you know the name of the extension you are looking for, the fastest way is to search it using Google or any other search engine, adding `drupal` to the search. For example: `drupal webform`
