In case you are using the fb_instant_articles module, please note that the RSS feed url will change
and therefore needs to be updated in the facebook account.

When updating while fb_instant_articles is enabled, there will be an error message like `The "fiafields" plugin does not exist. Valid plugin IDs for Drupal\views\Plugin\ViewsPluginManager are: ...`
this is due to invalid configuration present in the system before the update and can safely be ignored.
